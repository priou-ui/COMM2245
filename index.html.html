  <h2>WELCOME</h2>
  <p>This is my personal website, and on this page you can find data about myself, study subjects, and complete work. I am a student who is educating myself as an undergraduate and entering a graduate program. This website is a project in reflection of my aspirations to clearly and professionally show who I am, what I have done, and what I want to do.</p>
  <p>I am a Senior ready to graduate with a Bachelors in Psychology and a Minor in Mass Communications. I have always had an interest in human behavior, health, and the systems affecting the health of communities. I chose psychology because it helps you understand how people think, feel and interact with the world around them and mass communications because it helps you communicate those ideas you develop creatively to a variety of audiences.</p>
  <p>The site is split into sections. The About page provides a brief overview of my background and research interests, while the Education section contains my coursework and academic accomplishments. You can find a selection of my research work, science communication and health work in the Portfolio page. For academic opportunities, for professional opportunities, or for collaborative opportunities, contact the website through the Contact page.</p>
  <p>I plan that I will graduate with a degree in epidemiology, and I want to work in a career that researches and prevents public health issues, focusing on health inequities and that spreads basic, practical, and evidence-based public health information to others. This website reflects my current academic position including my core values. I invite you to explore about and learn more about my journey.</p>
