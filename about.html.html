  <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p>I am Prince George, a 23 year old undergraduate student within Princeton University. I major in Psychology with a minor in Mass Communications and will graduate in May 2011 with a B.A. I study human behavior and health outcomes. I communicate with target audiences. Through my studies I have developed strong analytical, research and communication skills that allow me to investigate social and health issues through using both scientific and media approaches.</p>
  <p>As a Psychology major, I am most interested in the relationships between mental health, behavior, and environmental factors and how these all play into the functioning and well-being of individuals and communities. My Minor in Mass Communications taught me how to communicate information clearly, ethically, and effectively in academic and public health venues. Professional settings needing customer focus required discretion. Adaptability occurred. Interpersonal skills mattered most.</p>
  <p>I want to go to graduate school for epidemiology after I graduate, and particularly involve myself in public health research and prevention in the long term, studying how diseases distribute and health is unequal, and communicating research to the population by finding knowledge from scientific research. Using data is my focus. Researching and communicating also help me improve health in communities. People can make decisions if I empower them.</p>
  <p>(He/him) I profess professionalism. I improve continually. I pursue work with a positive impact in the world.</p>
